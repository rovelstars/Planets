# TODO

Read <https://github.com/rovelstars/Planets/blob/main/packages/coreutils/TIP.md> for main reasons why we need to patch Nushell.

This patch is applied on Nushell source, instead of the dependency uutils, as it suffers from same issue above. Sending a PR to uutils and updating dependency in future should be done in the future.
